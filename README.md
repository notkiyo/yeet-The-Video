## 🤨 What even is this?

A YouTube, Insta, and etc video yeeter.  
MP4? ✅  
MP3? ✅  
Vibes? 🧃 Maxed out.

Using `customtkinter` because we like our UIs dark and moody,  
and `yt-dlp` because it works and we don’t ask questions.

## 🧠 How do I use it?

### With Poetry (because you're fancy):

> It’s a virtual env tool. You don’t need it but it makes you look cool.

```bash
pipx install poetry
cd (into the folder)
poetry install
poetry run python yt-dow.py
```

### Or the caveman way:

```bash
pip install customtkinter pillow yt-dlp requests
python yt-dow.py
```

## 🧰 Features

- Paste link. See video. No FBI yet.
- Choose where to save like you’re in charge of your life.
- MP4 download? Boom.  
- MP3 download? DOUBLE boom.  
- Thumbnail preview, 'cause aesthetics.
- Console messages to see what’s going on  
  (because I didn’t wanna build a progress bar).

## 💀 Known Issues

- Might crash if the link is bad. You knew what you were doing.
- The save dialog is ugly. Blame `tkinter`, not me.
- Sometimes it just doesn’t. We move.
